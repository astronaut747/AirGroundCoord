# Cooperative Air-Ground Robot Localization

## Project Overview
This project tackles the challenge of accurately estimating the position of an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) when GPS is unreliable or unavailable. By leveraging a cooperative approach between an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a UGV, this system enhances localization capabilities using advanced filtering techniques such as Linearized Kalman Filter (LKF) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).

## Key Features
- **Robust Localization**: Utilizes UAV for reliable GPS to aid UGV localization.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Implements both LKF and EKF to evaluate system dynamics and measurement sensitivities, ensuring high fidelity in state estimation.
- **Dynamic Interaction**: Facilitates dynamic interaction between air and ground units to achieve precise navigation.

## Technologies
- MATLAB for simulation and model implementation.
- Linearized and Extended Kalman Filtering techniques for state estimation under uncertainty.

## Getting Started
To run the simulation:
1. Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.
2. Download the project files and open them in MATLAB.
